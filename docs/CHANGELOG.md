Builds now support PHP8.4!

The icons for ratings and favorite flags are now SVG's which replaces the last png icons in the default theme.

A big change here is in the Browse class.

The logic of grid view has been normalized. Many logical issues reverse checking true/false and confusing text have been updated.

Clear all your cookies and site data after the upgrade as this affects many visual areas on the site.

## Ampache 6.5.0

This release is the final Ampache6 release with new features. Bug fixes and API extenstion only from now on!

Ampache Develop will become Ampache7 on the first of July as we move on to completing the next major release.

Cleaning up the Query class has helped ID and close a lot of bugs while allowing more options for API clients.

Ampache uses the Query class to create 'browses'. A browse is a query that allows filtering and sorting data.

This release has made greater use of browses reducing reliance on customizing mini functions to provide the same information.

### Removed

* Remove `disk` sort from `album` browse
* Remove `album` sort from `artist` browse
* Remove `call_sign` and `frequency` from `live_stream` browses (whatever they were)

### Fixed

* Fixed search rule JS showing the wrong lists id's in select items
* `catalog` browses using incorrect column
* `artist` browse by `song_artist` wasn't in the valid list
* Missing `video` browse filters on `clip`, `movie`, `personal_video`, `tvshow`, `tvshow_season` and `tvshow_episode` browses

* Stream::delete_now_playing query didn't work

Work on Ampache7 is ongoing.

Check out the [wiki](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/wiki/ampache7-for-admins) for information as some changes will be backported to Ampache6.

There has been a change to the way Random Searches work for Artist and Albums
These searches will now use to rules for that object type and then return the songs contained in those objects

* For example
  * You search using `random.php?action=advanced&type=album`
  * You search `album_rating == 5` and the `Item count` is set to 1
  * The search will find 1 album that is rated 5 and return **all** the songs in that album

### Added

* Translations 2024-05
* rtrim slashes on some config variables in case you ignore the warning

  * The returned results are still song objects but the searches are done using their rule set

### Fixed

* Album names being overwritten with artist names when missing tags
* Regenerate playlist track numbers correctly for the full list

## Ampache 6.2.1

The catalog verify process has been reworked a little. There were some bugs that would prevent you being able to 'finish' a catalog.

Definitely set `catalog_verify_by_time` if you have a large catalog. This will allow you to do a verify in small batches over time and not repeat the same songs.

* As well as [Ampache 5 for Users](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/wiki/Ampache-5-for-users)
* The bin folder has had a major [rework](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/wiki/cli-faq)
* You can pre cache files using [Transcode Caching](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/wiki/Transcode-Caching)

**IMPORTANT** instead of using date() we are now using IntlDateFormatter and your locale to identify formats.
This means that 'custom_datetime' based on the date() format is incorrect and will look weird.
Look here for the code to change your 'custom_datetime' string [(<http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/datetime>)]

This means Ampache now **requires** php-intl module/dll to be enabled.

**IMPORTANT** For new installs default database charset/collation and table engine have changed

* Engine MyISAM => InnoDB
* Charset utf8 => utf8mb4
* Collation utf8_unicode_ci => utf8mb4_unicode_ci

If you want to keep utf8 make sure you set it before running updates.

* To keep the current collation/charset update your config file
  * Set `database_charset = "utf8"`
  * Set `database_collation = "utf8_unicode_ci"`
