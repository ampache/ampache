# CHANGELOG

## Ampache develop

**IMPORTANT** instead of using date() we are now using IntlDateFormatter and your locale to identify formats.
This means that 'custom_datetime' based on the date() format is incorrect and will look weird.
Look here for the code to change your 'custom_datetime' string [(<http://userguide.icu-project.org/formatparse/datetime>)]

This means Ampache now **requires** php-intl module/dll to be enabled.

### Added
* Write metadata to mp3, flac and ogg files. Requires metaflac and vorbiscomment installed on Linux.
* Write images to mp3 and flac files. Also requires metaflac on linux.
* File tags can be updated from catalog management page.
* Configurable settings for "Gather Art".
* Configurable art search limit.

  * 'RatingMatch'. Raise the minimum star rating (and song loves) of artists and albums when you rate/love the song
* Run garbage collection after catalog_update.inc 'clean' or 'verify'
* Add duration to the table headers when browsing playlists and smartlists
* Add time and duration to albums, artists instead of calculating from songs each time
* Allow browsing by album_artist instead of artist
