# Ampache Release Guide

## Official Release Process

It's easy to use a program like github desktop to compare between branches.
**Use Linux**

* Open Github Desktop and pull latest develop / master
* Change to master branch
* Go to Branch Menu -> Update from develop
* Fix merge issues
  * lib/init.php (Set release version)
  * docs/CHANGELOG.md (Update for release)
* Commit merge but do not push!
* Undo commits and tag for new version (e.g. 4.1.0)
* Browse changes to check for things you've missed in the changelog
* Run composer install
* Remove broken symbolic links

```shell
  find . -xtype l -exec rm {} \;
```

* Create a zip package named "ampache-*.*.*_all.zip and add the entire ampache directory tree. (excluding git/development specific files)

```shell
  cd ampache
  zip -r -q -u -9 --exclude=./.git/* --exclude=./.github/* --exclude=./.tx/* --exclude=.gitignore --exclude=.gitattributes --exclude=.scrutinizer.yml  --exclude=.tgitconfig --exclude=.travis.yml ../ampache-4.1.0_all.zip ./
```

* Then unpack the exact zip and create a server to test basic functionality
  * FIXME This might be where unit testing would be helpful.
* Draft Release page online and save as draft using your changelog
* When drafting a new release, set target to master branch.
* The "ampache-*.*.*_all.zip" drop-in package is then uploaded.
* After setting version and title, save as draft
* Commit your waiting update to master
* Publish the new release
  * get the md5hash for the release page

```shell
md5sum ../ampache-4.1.0_all.zip 
```

## Additional requirements

* Update ampache-docker README.md with the current version. (This will kick off a build with the new version)
* Update config file in docker (ampache.cfg.php.dist) if it's changed as well
* Update and make a release for python3-ampache if api has changed
  * Use a test file (test.py?) for some basic API function.
  * FIXME what should it test?

## Update ampache-docker images on docker hub

Update the official Ampache docker images [<https://hub.docker.com/r/ampache/ampache>]

* To bump ampache-docker images rebuild for arm and amd64 using buildx [<https://github.com/docker/buildx>]
* After enabling experimental mode I installed the tools and buildx container.

This should only be needed once obviously
```bash
aptitude install qemu qemu-user-static qemu-user binfmt-support
docker buildx create --name mybuilder mybuilder
docker buildx use mybuilder
docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
```

Build master images and push to docker hub.

latest
```bash
git clone -b master https://github.com/ampache/ampache-docker.git ampache-docker/
cd ampache-docker
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 -t ampache/ampache:latest --push .
```

Build develop images and push to docker hub.
```bash
git clone -b develop https://github.com/ampache/ampache-docker.git ampache-docker-develop/
cd ampache-docker-develop
docker buildx build --platform linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7 -t ampache/ampache:develop --push .
```
