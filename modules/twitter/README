To enable twitter support to work for Amapche you have to first
have to register an app from Twitter's site.
http://dev.twitter.com/apps/new is the registration page.  After you
have registered you will be presented with two keys that you will need
to add to you ampache-doped.cfg.php file.  To enable it you need to add the
next three lines to your ampache-doped.cfg.php file.

twitter = true
twitter_consumer_key = "my_consumer_key"
twitter_consumer_secret = "my_consumer_secret"

After that you will see the Twitter 't' icon on the now playing section
of the Amapche front page.  Enjoy.
