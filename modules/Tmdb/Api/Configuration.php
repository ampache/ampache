     * Some elements of the API require some knowledge of this configuration data.

     * The purpose of this is to try and keep the actual API responses as light as possible.
     * It is recommended you store this data within your application and check for updates every so often.
     *
     * This method currently holds the data relevant to building image URLs as well as the change key map.
     *
     * To build an image URL, you will need 3 pieces of data.
     * The base_url, size and file_path.
     *
     * Simply combine them all and you will have a fully qualified URL. Hereâ€™s an example URL:
     *
