# TRANSLATIONS - Ampache Translation Guide

The official way to send in translations is via [Transifex](https://www.transifex.com/ampache/ampache/dashboard/).

* The official source language of Ampache is US English.
* Strings should only be translated where they differ from the source language.
* If a translation is not available, Ampache will fall back to US English.

## Introduction

Ampache uses gettext to handle the translation between different languages.
If you are interested in translating Ampache into a new language or updating
an existing translation please join us on Transifex.

Benifits to using the Transifex platform include:

* Everything is managed in a central location.
* Translations are updated in a single commit without conflicts.
* The current translation state is available to the team to understand the status of each language.

## Questions

If you have further questions, please feel free to open an issue here or start a new thread on our GoogleGroups forum and ask for @Psy-Virus - The Translation Guy.

Thanks and happy localizing!
