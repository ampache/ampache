## News

Ampache7 is [here!](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/releases/)

Information and changes for this major release are being recorded in the wiki [here](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/wiki/ampache7-for-admins).

Visual and informational changes for users are documented [here](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/wiki/ampache7-for-users).

Ampache7 will continue to use **API6** and will not make any breaking changes to that [API](https://ampache.org/api/).

## Basics

Ampache is a web based audio/video streaming application and file
manager allowing you to access your music & videos from anywhere,
using almost any internet enabled device.

Ampache's usefulness is heavily dependent on being able to extract
correct metadata from embedded tags in your files and/or the file name.
Ampache is not a media organiser; it is meant to be a tool which
presents an already organised collection in a useful way. It assumes
that you know best how to manage your files and are capable of
choosing a suitable method for doing so.

## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from an older version of Ampache we recommend
moving the old directory out of the way, extracting the new copy in
its place and then copying the old /config/ampache.cfg.php,
/rest/.htaccess, and /play/.htaccess files if any.
All database updates will be handled by Ampache.

## Admin tools and helper scripts

There are a lot of automation and helper tools used to help keep the Ampache release processes running smoothly.

The [Ampache Administrator](https://github.com/lachlan-00/ampache-administrator) repo is used to build, document and test all Ampache releases.

The [ampache-python3](https://github.com/ampache/python3-ampache) repo is used heavily in the admin repo and provides a few example scripts to do some simple tasks using the latest API versions.

The [Ampache Helper Scripts](https://github.com/icefields/Ampache-Helper-Scripts) uses lua and is being used to help in Android development and testing of [Power Ampache 2](https://github.com/icefields/Power-Ampache-2)
