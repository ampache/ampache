## Basics

Ampache is a web based audio/video streaming application and file
manager allowing you to access your music & videos from anywhere,
using almost any internet enabled device.

Ampache's usefulness is heavily dependent on being able to extract
correct metadata from embedded tags in your files and/or the file name.
Ampache is not a media organiser; it is meant to be a tool which
presents an already organised collection in a useful way. It assumes
that you know best how to manage your files and are capable of
choosing a suitable method for doing so.

## Recommended Version

The recommended and most stable version is [git HEAD](https://github.com/ampache/ampache/archive/master.tar.gz).

## Upgrading

If you are upgrading from an older version of Ampache we recommend
moving the old directory out of the way, extracting the new copy in
its place and then copying the old /config/ampache.cfg.php, /rest/.htaccess,
/channel/.htaccess, and /play/.htaccess files if any.
All database updates will be handled by Ampache.
