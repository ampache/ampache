     * Perform an advanced search given passed rules. This works in a similar way to the web/UI search pages.
     * You can pass multiple rules as well as joins to create in depth search results
     *
     * Rules must be sent in groups of 3 using an int (starting from 1) to designate which rules are combined.
     * Use operator ('and', 'or') to choose whether to join or separate each rule when searching.
     *
     * Rule arrays must contain the following:
     *   * rule name (e.g. rule_1, rule_2)
     *   * rule operator (e.g. rule_1_operator, rule_2_operator)
     *   * rule input (e.g. rule_1_input, rule_2_input)
     *
     * Refer to the wiki for further information on rule_* types and data
