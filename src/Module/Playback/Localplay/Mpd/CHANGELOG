========================================================

v1.3
ENHANCEMENTS
* Rewritten for PHP 5 and code cleanliness.
* Constants are class constants instead of global.
* Constructor now takes an optional callback parameter for hooking the internal
   debugging into your own.
* Returns false rather than null upon failure.
* Rather than splitting it out into variables, the state returned from MPD is
    all stored in arrays.  This decouples the class from the MPD version; new
    status variables don't have to be explicitly added.


v1.2 - Released 05/05/2004
ENHANCEMENTS
* Program version compatibility table now does not allow incompatible commands
    to be sent to the MPD. This is done to prevent sending outdated/incompatible
    commands.
* Added new MPD v0.9.1 commands: PLMove(), SetRandom(), SeekTo()
* Added MPD password authentication support.
* Added GetArtists() and GetAlbums() functions.
* Reflected 'volume' command deprecation in MPD v0.10.0

BUGFIXES
* None noted.


v1.1 - Released 09/23/2003
ENHANCEMENTS
* There is no longer the need to call RefreshInfo directly; it is automatically
    called upon connection to MPD. Although this may be considered a bad move by
    some purists, I feel that it substantially increases usability.
* Properties are now kept in sync with MPD. In other words, if a method call
    will modify a MPD stateful variable (such as AdjustVolume()), it also will
    modify the object's property.
* Methods that manually retrieve MPD settings (GetVolume(), GetStatistics(),
    etc.) will soon be deprecated. Instead, be a nice developer and use the
    object property (eg, $mpd->volume, $mpd->uptime, etc.).
* Added the Find() method. Syntax is similar to Search().
* Although the command queuing (bulk command) methods were included in v1.0,
    they were not documented. The QueueCommand() and SendCommandQueue() are now
    official methods.

BUGFIXES
* None noted.

v1.0 - Released 08/26/2003
