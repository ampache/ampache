The Ampache database username or password is missing
The following error has occurred, you will be automatically redirected in 10 seconds.
The following updates need to be performed:
The password has been set to: %s
The switches [-m|-o] can only be used, if one of the other switches [-c|-v|-a|-g] is used.

The validation key used isn't correct
There was an error sending your e-mail.
This affects all non-admin accounts
This attempts to connect to your database using the values read from your configuration file.
This checks a few key tables to make sure that you have successfully inserted the Ampache database and that the user has access to the database
This event has been logged.
This help message
This page handles all database updates to Ampache starting with <strong>3.3.3.5</strong>. Your current version is <strong>%s</strong> with database version <strong>%s</strong>.
This page handles the installation of the Ampache database and the creation of the ampache.cfg.php file. Before you continue please make sure that you have the following prerequisites:
This section applies the default transcoding configuration according to the application you want to use. You may need to customize settings once setup has ended.
This step creates and inserts the Ampache database, so please provide a MySQL account with database creation rights. This step may take some time on slower computers.
This step creates your initial Ampache admin account. Once your admin account has been created you will be redirected to the login page.
This step takes the basic config values and generates the config file. If your config/ directory is writable, you can select "write" to have Ampache write the config file directly to the correct location. If you select "download" it will prompt you to download the config file, and you can then manually place the config file in %s.
This subdirectory is not inside an existing Catalog. The update can not be processed.
This test attempts to read config/ampache.cfg.php. If this fails the file is either not in the correct location, or not readable.
This test makes sure that PHP is not running in safe mode. Some features of Ampache will not work correctly in safe mode.
This test makes sure that you have set all of the required configuration variables and that we are able to completely parse your config file.
This test makes sure that your web_path variable is set correctly and that we are able to get to the index page. If you do not see a check mark here then your web_path is not set correctly.
This tests whether Ampache can manage large files (> 2GB). This is not strictly necessary, but may result in a better experience. This generally requires a 64-bit operating system.
This tests whether Ampache can override the limit on maximum execution time. This is not strictly necessary, but may result in a better experience.
This tests whether Ampache can override the memory limit. This is not strictly necessary, but may result in a better experience.
This tests whether Ampache can upload medium files (>= 20M). This is not strictly necessary, but may result in a better experience.
This tests whether Ampache dependencies are installed.
This tests whether PHP %s is set as it may break the ID3 tag support. This is not stricly necessary, but enabling Ampache ID3 tag write support (disabled by default) along with mbstring.func_overload may result in irreversible corruption of your music files.
This tests whether PHP can write to config/. This is not strictly necessary, but will help streamline the installation process.
This tests whether the configuration template can be read.
This tests whether the file needed to initialize the database structure is available.
This tests whether the hash extension supports SHA256. This algorithm is required by Ampache.
This tests whether the MySQL driver for PDO is enabled. This driver is required by Ampache.

Transcoding allows you to convert music from one encoding to another. Ampache supports on the fly transcoding of any file type based on user, player, IP address or available bandwidth. In order to transcode, Ampache takes advantage of existing binary applications such as ffmpeg. In order for transcoding to work you must first install the supporting applications and ensure that they are executable by the web server.
