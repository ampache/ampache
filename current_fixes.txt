The logic in `SongId3TagWriter::class` wasn't designed to function outside the Song model from which it was relocated.
The Album model also wasn't designed to use the `SongId3TagWriter::class`. The class probably be renamed as it als writes flac pictures and vorbiscomments.

The Album model wasn't parsing/splitting album name.

Images from flac files can now be imported from file tags.  Maybe a false memory, but Ithought it could already do it.

Here are the mbidsand other data that can be written.

Song->mbid (UFID?) 
Album->mbid (MusicBrainz Album Id?)
 MusicBrainz Release Group Id, 
Original release year

When the artist's name is changed, the connection to the related song is lost.
